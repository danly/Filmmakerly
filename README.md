### Master Your Craft
##### Improve Your Skills With Monthly Filmmkaing Challenges
###Purpose

The purpose of this app is to help filmmakers of all abilities to get better at the art of filmmaking by creating monthly challenges that they can choose to do that are competitive and fun. 

The app provides a place for users to setup a basic profile and choose a challenge from a list. The challenges include a thumbnail image, description, due date, and tags such as a category and recommended skill level. 

Users complete the challenge by the due date, upload the completed challenge to Vimeo (for now), and then submit a link for review.
